# **Variation in the number of skilled birth attendants worldwide- UNICEF**

## Skilled birth attendants (SBAs) are health workers who are trained and qualified to provide care to women and newborns during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period. SBAs can include doctors, nurses,midwives, and other healthcare professionals who have received specialized training in maternal and newborn health. The presence of skilled birth attendants is a critical factor in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality rates.

## 1. **World map- Top 50 countries that have got highest skilled birth attendants**

![Graph type: World map](Rplot%20Worldmap.png)

*In many developing countries, there is a shortage of skilled birth attendants, which can lead to high maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Efforts to train and deploy more SBAs are important to global health initiatives to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes. So, the given data represents World Bank's regional classification system. The World Bank divides the world into six regions, each with its own
unique set of social and economic characteristics.*

***The six regions are***

*1.East Asia and Pacific* 
*2.Europe and Central Asia* 
*3.Latin America and Caribbean* 
*4.Middle East and North Africa* 
*5.South Asia*
*6.Sub-Saharan Africa*

*The World Bank uses this regional classification to analyze and compare
economic and social indicators across different countries and regions
which is the Number of skilled birth attendants here.*

## 2. **Bar graph - World Bank regions with the lowest number of skilled birth attendants**

![Graph type: Bar](Rplot%20Barplot.png)

*Population and life expectancy can both have an impact on the
percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel, as
countries with larger populations may have more resources to invest in
healthcare infrastructure, including training and employing skilled
health personnel. This could lead to a higher percentage of deliveries
attended by skilled health personnel. Similarly, countries with higher
life expectancy may have better overall healthcare systems, which could
include a higher percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health
personnel.*

## 3. **Scatter graph- population vs life expectancy for the observed value**

![Graph type: Scatter](Rplot%20SCATTER.png)

## 4. **Line graph- observed value countrywide for the time period**

![Graph type: Line](Rplot-New%20Line.png)

**Recent trend in % of skilled birth attendents shows that there is decline in number of SBAs over the years which might be the concern for health organisations and need to encourage youngsters to see a bright career into health care sector to lead world towards healthy lives.**

## However, it's important to note that many factors can impact the percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel, including cultural norms, economic factors, and access to healthcare services. Therefore, while population and life expectancy may correlate with this indicator, other variables may be more directly related.
